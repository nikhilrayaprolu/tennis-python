SOME OF THE GIT COMMANDS ::


git init 
Create empty Git repo in specified directory. Run with no arguments
to initialize the current directory as a git repository. 

git commit 
Replace the last commit with the staged changes and last commit
combined. Use with nothing staged to edit the last commit’s message.

git clone <repo> Clone repo located at <repo> onto local machine. Original repo can be
located on the local filesystem or on a remote machine via HTTP or SSH . 

git rebase <base> Rebase the current branch onto <base> . <base> can be a commit ID,
a branch name, a tag, or a relative reference to HEAD .

git config Define author name to be used for all commits in current repo. Devs
commonly use --global flag to set config options for current user. 

git reflog Show a log of changes to the local repository’s HEAD . Add
--relative-date flag to show date info or --all to show all refs.

git add Stage all changes in <directory> for the next commit.
Replace <directory> with a <file> to change a specific file. git commit -m "<message>" Commit the staged snapshot, but instead of launching a text editor,
use <message> as the commit message. 

git branch List all of the branches in your repo. Add a <branch> argument to
create a new branch with the name <branch> .

git status List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked. git checkout -b <branch> Create and check out a new branch named <branch> . Drop the -b
flag to checkout an existing branch.

git log Display the entire commit history using the default format.
For customization see additional options. 

git merge <branch> Merge <branch> into the current branch.

git diff Show unstaged changes between your index and working directory.

git remote add Create a new connection to a remote repo. After adding a remote,
you can use <name> as a shortcut for <url> in other commands.
<name> <url>

git revert Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in
<commit> , then apply it to the current branch. 

git fetch Fetches a specific <branch> , from the repo. Leave off <branch> to
fetch all remote refs.

git reset <file> Remove <file> from the staging area, but leave the working directory
unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes. 

git pull <remote> Fetch the specified remote’s copy of current branch and immediately
merge it into the local copy.

git clean -n Shows which files would be removed from working directory. Use
the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean. 

git push Push the branch to <remote> , along with necessary commits and
objects. Creates named branch in the remote repo if it doesn’t exist.
